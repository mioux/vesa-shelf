# vesa_shelf

This is a simple shelf that can be attached on VESA mount.

I made this to have a little displayer above my screens.

My first (non public) version had no rim (? i google translate this word :D), but my prints were falling as the shelf was too slippery.

~~I used [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4383974) for the mount. The rounded corners are removed because when sliced, the model was corrupted.~~

I remade all the model from scratch (it's not a very complex form), and set it in a signle file. There is no more cone head for the screw, so you can chose to fix the shelf onward or backward.

If you want to improve it, don't hesitate to fork and create a pull request.
