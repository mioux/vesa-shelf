# vesa_shelf

This is a simple shelf that can be attached on VESA mount.

I made this to have a little displayer above my screens.

My first (non public) version had no flange (? i google translate this word :D), but my prints were falling as the shelf was too slippery.

I used [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4383974) for the mount. The rounded corners are removed because when sliced, the model was corrupted.
